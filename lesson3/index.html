            <h3>yourmadisoncounty.org</h3>
            <p>This domain name is avalible for $12 a year</p>
        
            

             <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
             <p>The purpose of this site is to inform the people in Madison about the weather and what is going on such as news and other reports.<br>
                 I think it would also be great if there were a job board so that in your area you can put looking for jobs or you can put looking to hire.<br>
                 I would also like to add a housing link where you can find and search for housing in your area.<br> 
                 I think it would be a great way to get your news, weather, and find a job or find a place to live in Madison county. </p>
